# PawTracker

The application is developed using the Flutter framework, which ensures a seamless and consistent user experience across different platforms, making it compatible with Android devices. To manage and store data securely, PawTracker utilizes Firebase, a reliable cloud-based platform that enables real-time synchronization, ensuring users can access their pet's location and data from anywhere with an internet connection.

PawTracker offers a GPS pet tracking device paired with a mobile companion app. The device comes with a range of hardware features, such as active GPS/GPRS, Geofencing, LTE NB-IoT connectivity, Wi-Fi & Bluetooth, Cloud RTDB, smart strobing, and hardware provisioning.

On the software side, PawTracker provides cloud storage and RTDB, cloud authentication, active tracking, real-time telemetry, app notification, pet profile personalization, integration with Google and TomTom Maps, built-in hardware provisioning, and in-app pet location navigation.
